# html-css-block-menu
Simple, responsive block menu using only HTML and inline CSS (can be easily added to existing website)

## Scenario

- Given an already responsive page that looks something like this.

! [pageview](https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_sem_elements.gif)

- Our focus is the "article" area of the page. 




- The menu area is about 2/3 of the left side with nice margins. 
- The layout of the page reflects this limited section where our menu sections can go. 
- Each menu block typically has a title at the top. 
- 
- If viewing on a laptop, we can 2 or 3 if we can fit them, maybe only 1 item per row if on phone.
